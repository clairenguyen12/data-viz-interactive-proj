    <h1>Exploring gentrification trends of Chicago neighborhoods</h1>
    <p id='introduction'>
      Gentrification refers to the process of altering the demographic composition of a neighborhood.
      In Chicago, this process usually includes the replacement of low-income and/or minority
      residents by white, higher-income residents. The process typically lasts over several years.
      Gentrification has been a debatable policy issue because displaced residents believe
      that the influx of new residents prices out old residents and destabilizes their communities.
      On the other hand, gentrification also leads to lower crime rates and economic
      improvement in a neighborhood. Areas in Chicago that have been experiencing gentrification
      include Logan Square, Pilsen, Uptown, etc.

        Please use the interactive map below to explore the demographic trends for a Chicago
        neighborhood of your choice. When you hover your mouse over the map of Chicago's
        affordable housing on the left, you can see the name of the neighborhood and how many affordable
        units that neighborhood has.
        Once you click on your neighborhood of interest, you will be able to see, on the right side,
        how crime rates, median income, and racial demographics of the neighborhood have changed over
        time and evaluate if it has gone through gentrification or not.
